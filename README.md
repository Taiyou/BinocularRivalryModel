# PseudoBinocularRivalryProject
This is our repository to generate psuedo-binocular rivalry stimuli.

## Introduction

We referred to the binocular rivalry model by [Li et al., 2018](http://www.pnas.org/content/114/30/E6192). We leveraged an attention model of binocular rivalry stimuli to emulate dynamics of binocular rivalry transistions. Our report sheds light on phenomenological difference between real and peusdo binocular rivalry stimuli.
